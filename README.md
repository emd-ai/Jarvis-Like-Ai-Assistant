Jarvis Like AI Assistant
Welcome to the Jarvis Like AI Assistant repository! This project is a simple AI assistant that uses speech recognition, OpenAI's GPT-3, and text-to-speech to interact with users in a way that's inspired by JARVIS from the Iron Man movies.

Features
Speech Recognition: Converts spoken language into written text using the SpeechRecognition library.
Interaction with GPT-3: Sends user commands to the GPT-3 model using the OpenAI API and receives text responses.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the text responses from GPT-3 into spoken language using the pyttsx3 library.
Setup and Usage
To use this AI assistant, you'll need to install the necessary Python libraries and set up your OpenAI API key.

Install Libraries: You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
Copy code
pip install openai
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
Set Up OpenAI API Key: You'll need to sign up for an API key from OpenAI. Once you have your key, you can set it as an environment variable in your operating system, or replace os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") in the code with your actual key (be careful not to share your key publicly).

Run the Assistant: You can run the assistant by executing the Python script. The assistant will start listening for a command, process the command, and respond verbally.
